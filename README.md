# An Interactive Code Quiz 
## Project Description
At some point in my career as a full-stack developer, I'll most likely be asked to complete a coding activity, or assignment. This usually happens during the interview process.

Typically, a coding assignment will include multiple-choice questions, and interactive coding challenges.

Our assignment is to build timed coding quiz, with multiple choise questions. The app should run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. The assignment should be clean, polished, and have a responsive user interface.
